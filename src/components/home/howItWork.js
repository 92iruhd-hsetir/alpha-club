                        <p>As a community, we’re going to co-author a NYT best-selling book about NFTs and demonstrate the power of web3 for the whole world to see.</p>
                        <p>We have partnered with a 19x NYT best selling book publisher.</p>
                        <p>However, YOU, the NFT Community will come together to name the book, choose the Table of Contents, write, edit and promote the book. This will truly be a community effort. And the first time a NYT best-seller has been written by a community.</p>
                        <p>Games, contests and giveaways will be the mechanisms by which the work will be accomplished by the community. There will be art contests, writing contests, promotional contests, giveaways and partnerships that will ultimately produce the work we submit to our publishing agency. Then the publishing agency will take our rough draft, and turn it into a NYT best seller.</p>
                        <p>We’re looking for writers, artists, creators, builders, marketers, disrupters,  revolutionaries and the defenders of web3. This project is for those who want to shape the future and play an active role in the direction of the NFT space.</p>
