There will be art contests, writing contests, promotional contests, giveaways and partnerships that will ultimately produce the work we submit to our publishing agency. Then the publishing agency will take our rough draft, and turn it into a NYT best seller.</p>\r\n                        <p>We’re looking for writers, artists, creators, builders, marketers, disrupters,  revolutionaries and the defenders of web3.
